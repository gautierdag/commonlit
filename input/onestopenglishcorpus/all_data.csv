But an over-allocation, coupled with the effects of the financial crisis and recession, has led to a large surplus of permits on the market, which has in turn led to a plunge in permit prices. At current levels – a few euros per tonne of carbon – there is little incentive to seek out lower carbon fuels, and coal is enjoying a renaissance in Europe.', 'That means one of the world’s only regulatory market mechanisms aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions is failing in its key goals.

Well, Dr Izumi Tabata’s training\nprogramme – 20 seconds of intensive effort, ten\nseconds of rest, repeat eight times – promises\nthat it is possible to be fit with just 88 minutes of\ntraining a week.', 'Tabata remembers the first time he tested his\ntraining system on his university students in the\nearly 1990s. “After four minutes’ hard exercise they\nwere completely exhausted. They were almost\ndead! But after six weeks they saw the results and\nwere surprised. We all were surprised.”', 'Tabata created his training programme after he\nwatched Japan’s speed skating team in the early\n1990s. He saw that short bursts of very hard\nexercise were as effective as hours of normal\nexercise. Tabata tried to prove this with a simple\nexperiment. One group of students did an hour\nof cardiovascular exercise on an exercise bike\nfive times a week. The other group did a\nten-minute warm-up on the bike, then four\nminutes of Tabata training, four times a week –\nplus one 30-minute session of exercise with two\nminutes of Tabata.', 'The results were very surprising. After six weeks\nof testing, the group who did Tabata’s plan –\nexercising for just 88 minutes a week –\nincreased their anaerobic capacity by 28% and\ntheir VO2 max by 15%. The other group, who\ntrained for five hours every week, also\nimproved their VO2 max, but only by 10%.\nBut their training had no effect on their\nanaerobic capacity.', 'But you have to work very, very hard. You can’t\nsit on a machine, chewing gum and reading\nHELLO! magazine. You have to do intensive\nbursts of activity on an exercise bike or rowing\nmachine, explosive bodyweight exercises,\nsprints and so on. Remember how you felt after\ndoing a 100m sprint at school? Imagine doing\neight sprints with only a ten-second break\nbetween them.', '“Full effort at 170% of your VO2 max is the basis\nof the programme,” says Tabata. “If you feel OK\nafterwards you’ve not done it properly. The first\nthree repetitions will feel easy but the last two\nwill feel impossible. In the original plan, we\nwanted eight repetitions, but some people could\nonly do six or seven.”', 'One person on an online forum wrote: “Most\npeople cannot do it correctly and they shouldn’t\neven try.” Tabata doesn’t completely agree.\n“Everyone can do it but beginners should start\nwith educated trainers so that they don’t work\ntoo hard,” he explains. He also says that his\nprogramme burns an extra 150 calories in the 12\nhours after exercise. Most people use it to get fit\nor to get even fitter, but the programme also\nburns fat.', 'So, it’s a little surprising that at the moment only\nserious athletes are doing the programme. This\nmay change because Tabata says there will soon\nbe Tabata instructors and a series of DVDs at the\nend of the year. “I decided to do this because I\noften go on YouTube and some people are doing\nit wrong because they don’t understand how hard\nthey need to work,” says Tabata.', 'So, should we all start using Tabata in our fitness\nprogrammes? Richard Scrivener, a former rugby\nfitness coach, says that you should not stop your\nusual training; Tabata training is something extra.\n“Runners, for example, need to run a lot of miles\nin their training,” he says. “But they could do\nfewer long runs by introducing Tabata training.\nThis will give their bodies the chance to rest and\nrecover, especially if they have injuries.”', 'Gym fans can benefit by doing three strength\nsessions and three Tabatas a week.

Defendants\nhave often been convicted of offences based\non eyewitness testimony only to have their\nconvictions later overturned when DNA, or some\nother corroborating evidence, is brought to bear.', 'form in the human brain, Susumu Tonagawa,\na neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute\nof Technology (MIT), and his team encoded\nmemories in the brains of mice by manipulating\nindividual neurons. Memories of experiences\nwe have had are made from several elements,\nincluding records of objects, space and time.\nThese records, called engrams, are encoded\nin physical and chemical changes in brain cells\nand the connections between them. According\nto Tonagawa, both false and genuine memories\nseem to rely on the same brain mechanisms.', 'In their work, Tonagawa’s team used a technique\nknown as optogenetics, which allows the fine\ncontrol of individual brain cells. They engineered\nbrain cells in the mouse hippocampus, a part\nof the brain known to be involved in forming\nmemories, to express the gene for a protein\ncalled channelrhodopsin. When cells that contain\nchannelrhodopsin are exposed to blue light,\nthey become activated. The researchers also\nmodified the hippocampus cells so that the\nchannelrhodopsin protein would be produced in\nwhichever brain cells the mouse was using to\nencode its memory engrams.', 'In the experiment, Tonagawa’s team placed the\nmice in a chamber and allowed them to explore\nit. As they did so, relevant memory-encoding\nbrain cells were producing the channelrhodopsin\nprotein. The next day, the same mice were placed\nin a second chamber and given a small electric\nshock, to encode a fear response. At the same\ntime, the researchers shone light into the mouse\nbrains to activate their memories of the first\nchamber. That way, the mice learned to associate\nfear of the electric shock with the memory of the\nfirst chamber.', 'In the final part of the experiment, the team\nplaced the mice back in the first chamber.\nThe mice froze, demonstrating a typical fear\nresponse, even though they had never been\nshocked while there. “We call this ‘incepting’ or\nimplanting false memories in a mouse brain,”\nTonagawa told Science.', 'A similar process may occur when powerful false\nmemories are created in humans. “Humans\nare very imaginative animals,” said Tonagawa.\n“Independent of what is happening around you\nin the outside world, humans constantly have\ninternal activity in the brain. So, just like our\nmouse, it is quite possible we can associate what\nwe happen to have in our mind with bad or good\nhigh-variance ongoing events. In other words,\nthere could be a false association of what you\nhave in your mind rather than what is happening\nto you.”', 'He added: “Our study showed that the false\nmemory and the genuine memory are based on\nvery similar, almost identical, brain mechanisms.\nIt is difficult for the false memory bearer to\ndistinguish between them.

I’m a prolific\nwriter. I just can’t stop,” she says, phoning me\na few days after the interview to read out a\nditty she has written about the joys of exercise.\nOne of the class, 84-year-old former teacher\nWinnie Robertson, thinks the secret to staying\nfit is never letting yourself go: “Use it or lose it,\nthat’s what I say.”', 'Allen still plays the piano and gives speeches.\nShe is president of the Women’s Fellowship\nat the local methodist church and is one of\nthree 90-plus year olds at the scrabble club\nof the University of the Third Age. She did a\ncomputer course when she was 88 and tried to\nget online, but it didn’t work out.', 'Ageing is no fun, she admits, reading me a few\nlines from a poem she has written called ‘That\nBeast Called Age’. She happily recalls a doctor\nwho saw her for the first time a few years back,\nwho said she couldn’t possibly be more than\n78: “I said, ‘Thank you, doctor. You can\ngo now.’”', 'She also has a no-nonsense attitude to weight\ngain: “I just think people shouldn’t eat too much. Whenever I hear someone saying, ‘Oh,\nI can’t lose weight’, I say: ‘Sellotape.’” She\nmimes taping her mouth shut. “I said this just\nthe other day to a big fat man. Everything in\nmoderation is my motto.”', 'Earlier in 2013, Allen was watching the news\nand saw a woman being given the British\nEmpire Medal. I think she means Margaret\nChartwood from Horley, who was given the\nhonour in January, at the age of 77. “She\nwas saying: ‘I’m 80 and I’m the oldest fitness\ninstructor in the country!’ I was thinking:\n‘No, you’re not.’ But I shan’t be writing to\nBuckingham Palace.”']"

A bit more Japanese.', 'Iguchi’s augmented reality glasses, which\naren’t really glasses so much as a single piece\nof metal with a camera and a micro-projector,\nare called Telepathy One, and, after unveiling\nthem at the South by Southwest festival in\nAustin, Texas, they have attracted $5m of\nventure capital. Like Glass, Telepathy One is\ndue to launch in 2014.', 'It’s a stripped-down, simplified version of\nGoogle Glass. Whereas Glass is, he says,\n“an egotistical device” with a range of uses\n– you can surf the net, read emails, take\nphotographs, do unspecified things with as\nyet unspecified apps – Telepathy will be “more\nof a communication device”. Connected via\nBluetooth to your phone, it will focus on realtime\nvisual and audio sharing. You’ll be able to\npost photos and videos from your line of vision\non Facebook or send them as an email. Or see\nand speak to a floating video image of a friend.', '“It will help bring you close to your friends\nand family. We are very focused on the\ncommunication and sharing possibilities,” says\nIguchi, who has worked in the Japanese tech\nindustry for 20 years, most recently\ndeveloping a location-based phone app called\nSekai Camera.', 'Of course, not everyone wants to get closer\nto the man in the futuristic headset, I point\nout. Iguchi shakes his head. “I’m a visionary.\nI have a dream that people will understand\nother people. When I go to London, I am a\nstranger. Sometimes I feel fear. But I believe\nthat everyone wants to be understood and to\nunderstand each other. And, with this device,\nyou can know more information about people\nbefore you even speak to them.”', 'Compared to the likes of Google, of course,\nTelepathy is a minnow. Not that this seems\nto daunt Takahito Iguchi. In his shared office\nspace in San Francisco – a cool, converted\nwarehouse in the heart of startup land, filled\nwith twentysomethings – he quotes Sun\nTzu’s The Art of War and points out that\neven tiny armies can sometimes beat mighty\nforces. When he was growing up, Japanese\ntechnology ruled the world: the Sony Walkman\nwas the iPhone of its day. Now, to compete,\nhe’s had to quit Tokyo for Silicon Valley.', '“Tokyo is very rich in fashion and culture but\nit’s still an island. It’s isolated. There is not any\nway to expand. Whereas, in Silicon Valley,\neveryone is from everywhere. It’s where you\ncome to connect globally.” The hardware will\nbe made in Japan, while he is putting together\na team of software engineers in the US to\ndevelop its applications. On the day I meet\nhim, he’s being shadowed by a news crew\nfrom Japan who are interested in the new\nwave of Japanese entrepreneurs being forced\nto leave their homeland.', '“We are losing our confidence,” the\ncorrespondent, Takashi Yanagisawa, tells\nme. “And we need to find a way to regain our\npower. Iguchi is kind of like the new frontier.\nWe hope he might be a new solution.” Building\nthe prototype of Telepathy One was easy,\nIguchi says. “We have every sort of technology\nin Tokyo. It is presenting it to the world that is\nthe challenge.” The leading manufacturers are\nlining up to work with him, he says, because\nthey have the technology, they just struggle\nto sell it. “There needs to be a story to the\nproduct. Like Apple did with the iPod – 1,000\nsongs in your pocket. And the way they positioned themselves against Microsoft and\nIBM, it was like the story of David and Goliath.\nAnd Steve Jobs was inspired by Akio Morita,\nthe co-founder of Sony, and he inspired me, so\nmaybe it will come in a circle.”', 'Maybe. He certainly has the confidence of\nJobs, although, with a thick Japanese accent,\nhe sometimes struggles to make himself\nunderstood, a fact that may have contributed\nto Telepathy One’s conception. When he\nwent to London to present the headset at the\nprestigious Founders Forum, he stayed in an\nAirbnb. “The house owner was not my friend\nbut I talked with him for three hours, and now\nhe is my friend. That is how long it takes to\nunderstand each other, to share our feelings,\nand background, and career. Maybe Telepathy\nmakes that shorter. If you are getting info from\nthe cloud and social networks, that will happen\nmore easily. And this man is involved in getting\ninvestment from UK to Africa, and he was very\nexcited about Telepathy, that it would be a way\nof educating people about Africa, of showing\nthem other people’s point of view.”', 'This is Iguchi’s fondest hope – that seeing\nsomebody else’s literal point of view will\nhelp you to see their metaphorical point of\nview. As a student, he explains, he studied\nphilosophy by day and taught himself how\nto code by night. “And, one day, I opened\nthe door of my apartment and I suddenly\nrealized that everything is code. That was my\nenlightenment. Everything is coded and is\nshareable between humans. And everything\ncan be encoded and decoded. And, if code is\nexchangeable between humans, that will end\nall war against each other.”']"

Through their spending on property, vehicles and holidays, it is estimated that each winner keeps six people in a full-time job for a year.', 'Winners have contributed almost £750m to gross domestic product (GDP), and generated more than £500m in tax receipts for the Exchequer. The bulk of the money went on property, with £2.72bn spent on winners’ main properties, and £170m in paying off existing debt and mortgages.', 'Maintaining income was a priority, with £2.125bn spent on investments. Gifts to family and friends accounted for £1.17bn, and £680m was spent on cars and holidays.', 'The study, commissioned by Camelot, the operators of the UK National Lottery, to mark the 3,000-winners milestone, was based on research from 100 £1m-plus winners. It found that in total the 3,000 winners have purchased 7,958 houses or flats in the UK, or 2.7 each, spending £3.3bn. Most winners (82%) changed their main residence, spending an average £900,000.', 'The new home is likely to come with a hot tub, with almost a third (29%) putting that on their shopping list. A walk-in wardrobe was a must for 28%, almost a quarter (24%) opted for a property behind electric gates, and 22% had a games room, with 7% installing a snooker table.', 'Larger properties need maintaining, and 30% of winners employed a cleaner and 24% a gardener. A small proportion (5%) employed a beautician.', 'Audis were the favourite cars of 16% of winners, with Range Rovers and BMWs also popular purchases (11% each), as well as Mercedes (10%) and Land Rovers (5%). Winners spent £463m on 17,190 cars,\nwith the average price of their favourite being £46,116.', 'Holidays were also a priority. The majority (68%) choose five-star hotels overseas. The US was the favoured destination for 27%, followed by the Caribbean (9%). Closer to home, however, UK caravan sales have benefited. Over the past 18 years, 10% of millionaires have bought a caravan, generating sales worth about £7.4m.', 'Some winners (15%) have started their own businesses, 9% have helped others to do so, and 6% have invested in or bought other people’s businesses. Businesses started or supported by lottery winners employ 3,195 people, according to the study.', 'Andy Logan, author of the report, said: “The effect of a win spreads much further and wider than we anticipated. Not only does it transform the lives of friends and family, but each win has a measurable effect on the UK economy, especially with so much of it being spent in the UK. The use of each win creates a ripple effect across this generation and very often the next.”']"

In captivity, great apes often live to 50 or more. The nadir in the animals’ well-being occurred, on average, at 28.3 and 27.2 years old for the chimpanzees, and 35.4 years old for the orangutans.', '“In all three groups we find evidence that\nwell-being is lowest in chimpanzees and orangutans at an age that roughly corresponds to midlife in humans,” Weiss said. “On average,\nwell-being scores are lowest when animals are around 30 years old.”', 'The team explains that the temporary fall in ape well-being may result from watching depressed apes dying younger, or through age-related changes in the brain that are mirrored in humans.', 'Weiss conceded that, unlike men, apes are not known to pursue radical and often disastrous lifestyle changes in middle age.', 'Robin Dunbar, Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at Oxford University, was dubious about the findings. “What can produce a sense of well-being or contentedness that varies across the lifespan like this? It’s hard to see anything in an ape’s life that would have that sort of pattern, that they would think about. They’re not particularly good at seeing far ahead into the future; that’s one of the big differences between them and us.”', 'Alexandra Freund, Professor of Psychology at the University of Zurich, was also sceptical. She said the concept of a midlife crisis was shaky even in humans. “In my reading of the literature, there is no evidence for the midlife crisis. If there’s any indication of decline in emotional or subjective well-being it is very small and, in many studies, it’s not there at all.”', 'But Weiss believes the findings could point to a deeper understanding of the emotional crisis some men may experience. “If we want to find the answer as to what’s going on with the midlife crisis, we should look at what is similar in middle-aged humans, chimps and orangutans,” he said.']"

At the beginning of the twentieth\ncentury, life expectancy in the UK stood at\naround 47 years of age for a man and 50\nfor a woman, a number heavily affected by\nthe very high rate of infant mortality in those\ndays. Around a third of all deaths occurred in\nchildren under the age of five, largely because\nof infectious disease.', 'In contrast, a child born in Britain today has\na better than one in four chance of reaching\ntheir 100th birthday. For this we have public\nhealth systems, vaccination and antibiotics to\nthank. It is by these means – the prevention\nand treatment of illnesses caused by\nmicroorganisms – that the real war against\ndisease is principally won.', 'Elsewhere, we have pushed the limits of\nsurvival, notably in intensive care. This,\nthe specialism in which I chose to train, is\nwhere antibiotic resistant organisms are most\nprevalent. Here, powerful antibiotics, essential\nin the treatment of life-threatening illness, are\nused routinely. These drugs decimate ordinary\nbacteria. But what they leave behind are hardy\nspecies that have begun to learn tricks that\nallow them to evade antibiotic drugs.', 'As a newly qualified doctor in the late\n1990s, I learnt about Methicillin Resistant\nStaphylococcus Aureus – the infamous MRSA\n– a bacterial species resistant to methicillin\nand all other penicillins. In the fight against it,\nthere were a handful of exotic-sounding drugs\n– vancomycin and teicoplanin among them.\nThese were supposed to be our last lines\nof defence, but antibiotic resistant bacteria\nbecame more and more common; as did\nspecies with new patterns of resistance. Drugs\nwe had previously barely heard of became\ncommonplace. New last-line drugs emerged\nto replace the old. We got used to this state of\naffairs; a steady escalation in the arms race\nbetween us and the bacteria.', 'But the balance has been shifting steadily. In\nour hospitals and our GP surgeries we have\nabused the drugs that gave us such a huge\nadvantage over infectious disease, using them\ntoo often and too indiscriminately. And some\nof the worst abuses have occurred outside of\nhealthcare, with antibiotics introduced into the\nfood chain, through agriculture and the lacing\nof livestock feed with anti-bacterial drugs.\nWe assumed that antibiotic therapy was an\nadvantage we could enjoy forever. We became\ncomplacent that the pharmaceutical industry\nwould continue to stay ahead of\nthe game.', 'But this is no longer the case. New, more\nresistant species have been identified. The\nvancomycin that we used to rely on to treat\nMRSA infection was defeated. Vancomycin\nResistant Staphylococcus Aureus (VRSA)\nemerged in our hospitals. And other bacterial\nspecies were learning the same trick.\nEnterobacteria, organisms usually found in the\ngut, had also acquired vancomycin resistance.\nToday, infections with formidable, highly\nresistant organisms are commonplace and the\npharmaceutical industry is not keeping pace.\nFewer and fewer new anti-microbial drugs\nare emerging from their production lines. It\nis becoming increasingly difficult to develop\nnew drugs active against resistant strains. For\nevery method of attack the pharmaceutical\ncompanies invent, bacteria rapidly evolve a\ndefence. All of the simple approaches to the\nproblem have been exhausted. Antibiotics have become drugs that are expensive to\ndevelop, that are only used in short courses\nand that quickly become ineffective due to the\nevolution of bacterial resistance. Consequently,\nthe pharmaceutical industry’s incentive to\nmanufacture new drugs that can fight them\nis low.', 'Almost as soon as antibiotic use became\nwidespread in the 1940s, the first evidence of\nbacteria resistance to antimicrobial therapy\nemerged. Initially, these were little more than\ncuriosities. When they did infect patients, the\nnumbers were so small that at first they were\nnot enough to warrant much attention. But\ntoday, they have become a fact of medical\nlife. Less than a century after the discovery of\npenicillin, we are beginning to lose the fight.', 'Since the first MRSA deaths in otherwise\nhealthy children in the US in 1998, the number\nof deaths from MRSA infection in the US\neach year has risen to tens of thousands –\noutstripping the number of deaths caused\nby AIDS. Bacterial resistance in hospitals is\neverywhere you look. This is a war like no\nother. There needs to be cultural change in\nour prescribing behaviours and more restraint\nin the use of antibiotics in farming and\nagriculture. And somehow, the pharmaceutical\ncompanies have to be convinced to chase the\ndevelopment of these less profitable drugs.', 'Within my working lifetime, the pattern\nof antibiotic resistance in healthcare has\ntransformed from a rare but notable event to\na problem of epidemic proportion. If we are to\navoid a return to the pre-antibiotic time with\nall its excess mortality, we must be bold. To\nsquander the advantage we have so recently\ngained against microorganisms in the fight for\nlife would be unthinkable.', nan, nan]"

What Huffington\nemphasizes about sleep, after all, is not that\nit rests you but that it restores you. Sleep, she\nsays, is the ultimate performance enhancer\nand getting eight hours of rest has become the\nultimate status symbol.', 'You know how Arianna Huffington gets her eight\nhours? Well, for one thing, she has “nine or so”\nassistants, according to a recent New York Times\nprofile. Huffington calls them her “A-Team”;\nthey do everything from running her errands to\nplanning her travel to loading The Huffington Post\non her computer in the morning. According to the\nTimes, most of the A-Team can only endure about\n12 months of the work because it’s so taxing. The\nlow pay also means many of them take second\njobs. Basically, they don’t sleep so that Huffington\ncan … and can sell books about it.', 'Getting enough sleep isn’t just a question of\nvaluing sleep enough to go to bed at the right\ntime; it’s a question of going to bed in the right\nneighbourhood and in the right body. Numerous\nstudies show that you’re more likely to sleep\npoorly if you’re poor. It’s hard to sleep if you’re\nworried about your safety or haven’t had enough\nto eat. It’s hard to sleep if you’re one of the 15\nmillion American shift workers who work irregular\nhours. Research has also found that there’s a\nblack/white sleep gap. One study shows that,\nwhile white people sleep an average of 6.85\nhours, African Americans sleep an average of\n6.05 hours. They also have a lower quality of\nsleep. Researchers have attributed this, in part,\nto the stress of discrimination.', 'Want to know who gets the most sleep and\nthe best quality of sleep in America? Wealthy\nwhite women. Which, if I’d hazard a guess, is\nprobably the same demographic Huffington is\ntargeting her book at. Huffington describes her\npromotion of sleep as a “revolution” but, really,\nit’s a rebranding. The very real sleep crisis we\nface isn’t down to a few rich people thinking it’s a\nwaste of time; it’s down to the 99% not being able\nto afford to spend time sleeping.', 'While sleep is currently enjoying a moment,\nit will probably be short-lived. Sleep may be\na performance enhancer but it’s an inefficient\none. The real prize is finding a way to negate\nsleep deprivation so humans can function on\nless sleep. Unsurprisingly, the military is at the\nforefront of this research. In 2008, the Pentagon\npublished a report called “Human Performance”\nwhich examined the possibility of a future in\nwhich soldiers could perform at their peak with\nonly a couple of hours’ sleep. “Suppose a human\ncould be engineered who slept for the same\namount of time as a giraffe (1.9 hours per night). This would lead to an approximately twofold\ndecrease in the casualty rate. An adversary\nwould need an approximately 40% increase in\nthe troop level to compensate for this advantage.”\nThe report goes on to look at the effects of\nampakines, a class of drugs that modulate\nneurotransmitters in the brain, to remove the\neffects of sleep deprivation.', 'Eventually, humans will figure out a way to\nget rid of sleep. Spending a third of your life\nunconscious won’t be a luxury anymore; it’ll be\nsomething only the poor will be forced to do. At\nwhich point, we may need a whole new sort of\nsleep revolution.']"

"['Dr Ben Brabon of Edgehill University teaches a MOOC – a massive open online course. The course is one of only two accredited MOOCs in the UK at the moment. Brabon says that many students enrol on MOOCs because they are free and they enjoy communicating with other students. MOOCs have no entry tests and no fees, so MOOC students behave very\ndifferently from students on normal higher education courses.', 'MOOCs are the newest idea to try to make higher education available to everyone. Companies are investing a lot of money in new websites that offer sophisticated and interactive courses to tens of thousands of students. Investors hope to find a business model for MOOCs that will make them profitable. They could earn money by finding out why and when millions of students enrol, interact with their material, submit their assignments, message each other and stop the course.', 'Nobody can say exactly who MOOCs are for. Universities that want to attract fee-paying international students onto postgraduate courses by showing them their best programmes online? Students in developing countries who really want access to first-world universities? Employees who wish to develop their professional knowledge? People without qualifications who want to use MOOCs as a bridge to higher education? Or hobby learners, who want to learn about a subject they find interesting?', 'MOOCs may be popular at the beginning but very few people complete them, says Dr Brabon. His literature course had 1,000 enrolments but only 31 people completed the course. “And almost all of those had a first degree or had been educated to degree level,” he says. “So it seems MOOCs do not make higher education available to people who couldn’t go into higher\neducation before.”', '“Learning online is a different thing and needs quite advanced learning skills,” says David Kernohan, an expert in digital technology. “With MOOCs, there’s very little support: the student does not get any individual attention.” Students get support from other students in online discussions.

Eel ecologist\nThe job: Conserving the critically endangered\nEuropean eel', 'What it involves: To monitor the size of the\nendangered eels, ecologists wade into the Thames\nand other London rivers and marshes full of eels,\nsometimes up to their armpits, and reach into a net\nfi lled with up to 20 adult eels to grab one with their bare\nhands. “Adult eels can be a metre long, or even larger,\nand weigh up to 2kg. They’re not at all dangerous but\nthey are almost pure muscle and they can be a little\nbit slimy,” says Stephen Mowat, an eel conservationist\nand ecologist for the Zoological Society of London. “We\nhave to weigh and measure them, and they wriggle …\na lot. It’s diffi cult to look professional while crawling on\nthe ground chasing an eel across the grass.”', 'Worst part of the job: “Eels are really tricky creatures\nto work with – and getting outsmarted by an eel can\nbe quite embarrassing,” says Mowat. “You also have\nto be ready to jump from one project to the next. I\nonce had to dissect a tub of dead eels to examine\nparasites living in them, moments before jumping\ninto a suit for a meeting with government offi cials. I\nremembered to wash my hands.” But, for Mowat, the\nworst part of the job is defi nitely not handling the eels\n– he believes baby eels (known as elvers) are “as cute\nas pandas”: “The worst thing about the job is regularly\nlearning how much damage we, the British population,\nare doing to the environment.”', 'Job satisfaction: “Getting to work outdoors and\nseeing British wildlife up close is the best part of the\njob,” says Mowat. “Eels are beautiful creatures and\nworking with eels doesn’t just benefi t the eel: it helps\nwhole river systems, estuaries and coastal habitats.\nThat is something worth working on.”', '5.

Actors like Fiennes will\nonly agree to be in a film if they like the director.”', 'Though the Bond series was not in trouble before\nMendes’s arrival – and Craig’s – there was a certain\namount of staleness towards the end of Pierce\nBrosnan’s time as Bond. The series had survived\nthe drying up of original Bond stories to adapt, and\nthe movies were no longer anything like the Ian\nFleming originals, but they were lacking dynamism.', 'This cycle, however, was nothing new: the history\nof the Bond series has been one of ebb and flow,\nrevolving most obviously around the lead actor:\nfirst, Sean Connery; then, successively, George\nLazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Brosnan\nand, now, Craig. Each new Bond has been a\nresponse to the state of the series, and some have\nbeen more successful than others.', 'Lazenby only lasted a single film and Dalton’s two\nefforts, The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill,\nwere during a period in the late 80s when the 007\nmovie was eclipsed by more aggressive, slick\nHollywood action movies. According to Gant, “the\nperiod of Roger Moore’s last films, and the Dalton\nperiod, didn’t really excite audiences. Brosnan was\nmore successful commercially, but Craig has taken\nBond to new levels. On the other hand, the early\nBonds were incredibly commercial films, sexy and\nexciting, and there was very little like them.”', 'Skyfall made more money than all the other Bond\nfilms. However, the performance of some of the\n1960s films was almost as brilliant by comparison. If\nyou adjust the figures for inflation, the 1965 release,\nThunderball, is only just below Skyfall, while\nGoldfinger and You Only Live Twice both did better\nthan the other Craig films (and the 70s Bonds,\nThe Spy Who Loved Me and Live and Let Die, did\nbetter, too). By this calculation, Licence to Kill is the\nworst-performing of all Bonds, with Moore’s final\nfilm, A View to a Kill, the second least successful.', 'Nevertheless, the Bond brand has remained very\npowerful over the years and Eon has had to fight\noff attempts by rival companies to capitalize on the\npopularity of the series. Through a quirk of rights\nownership, adaptations of Casino Royale (in 1967)\nand Thunderball (as Never Say Never Again,\nin 1983) were released in competition with Eon\nproductions. After legal disputes that continued for\nmany years, Eon now has full control of both books.', 'Martin Campbell was another experienced British\ndirector and he was able to plan one of the most\nelaborate stunts in Bond history. In the famous\nopening scene of Goldeneye (released in 1995),\nBond freefalls into a pilotless light aeroplane. This\nscene really helped modernize the series and\nincrease its popularity. Moreover, a whole new\ngeneration was reached through a hugely successful\nGoldeneye video-game spin-off, which made a\nsignificant contribution to perceptions that the Bond\nfilm was no longer stale and old-fashioned.', nan, nan, nan]","['He is the star of one of the world’s longest running\nand most successful film series, with 23 movies and\nmore than $6bn amassed at the global box office,\nbut James Bond shows no signs of slowing down.\nIn fact, the Bond brand is stronger than ever, after\nthe record-breaking performance of Skyfall, which\nbecame the biggest ever film at the UK box office\non its release in 2012 and, with its total earnings of\n$1.1bn, currently stands in ninth place of all-time\nlargest earners.', 'Hence the intense interest that surrounded the\nannouncement of a few more details of the 24th\nBond film – not the least its official title, Spectre.\nThe number one question is this: can Spectre\nrepeat the Skyfall trick? Will Skyfall remain a high\nwater mark for the Bond movie or can Spectre\nextend this winning run?', 'Charles Gant, film editor for Heat magazine, says\nthe indications are it is heading in the right direction.\n“Skyfall was a brilliant strategic move,” he says. “It\nwas cleverly positioned as simultaneously modern\nand retro. It appealed to the Daniel-Craig-era fans,\nwho are relative newcomers to the franchise, and it\nalso managed to engage the older, more nostalgic\nelements of the audience, who may have lost\ninterest over the previous few films. With the new\ntitle,” he adds, “they are already on to a winner. My\nfeeling is that Spectre announces that they want to\nhang on to the nostalgic, more age-diverse Bond\nfan, as well as retaining the younger audience.”', 'The initial signs are that Eon Productions, the\ncompany originally founded in 1961 to make Dr No\nand that is behind all the “official” Bonds, is doing its\nutmost to ensure lightning strikes twice by installing\nthe key creative talent behind Skyfall on Spectre.\nDaniel Craig has been tied down at least until Bond\n25, while the same writers have produced the script.', 'But it’s the recapture of director Sam Mendes that\ngives Bondwatchers the most hope. A director\nprincipally known for character studies such as\nAmerican Beauty and Revolutionary Road, Mendes\nhas taken the Bond series to new heights. Gant\nsays: “Mendes managed to engage with both the\nmodern and the traditional Bond audience, and he\nalso pulled in high-calibre actors like Ralph Fiennes.\nTo get actors like Fiennes in, they have to be happy\nwith the director.”', 'Among other achievements, Skyfall virtually\ndoubled the box office of its predecessor, Quantum of\nSolace, which managed a worldwide figure of $586m\non its release in 2008. No one is expecting anything\nlike that this time, but Eon will not be complacent.', 'Though the Bond series was not in trouble before\nMendes’s arrival – and Craig’s – there was the\nsense of a certain amount of staleness towards\nthe end of Pierce Brosnan’s run. The series had\nsurvived the drying up of actual Bond stories to\nadapt, the movies having long since departed from\nany resemblance to the Ian Fleming originals, but it\nwas lacking a certain dynamism.', 'This cycle, however, was nothing new: the history\nof the Bond series has been one of ebb and flow,\nstasis and renewal, revolving most obviously\naround the lead actor: first, Sean Connery; then,\nsuccessively, George Lazenby, Roger Moore,\nTimothy Dalton, Brosnan and, now, Craig.

Although subject to legal disputes\nover several decades, Eon now has full control of\nboth books.', 'Casino Royale, whose rights had been individually\nsold off by Fleming in 1955, eventually passed to\nEon in 1999 as a result of an agreement between\nEon’s backers, MGM, and rival Hollywood studio\nSony – thereby clearing the way for the 2006\nversion. Thunderball, on the other hand, owed its\ndisputed status to writer-producer Kevin McClory,\nwho helped Fleming outline the original story\nand who claimed ownership of the novel over\nsubsequent decades, and produced Never Say\nNever Again as a result. After McClory’s death in\n2006, his family eventually settled with MGM and\nEon’s parent company in November 2013.', 'If the initial surge of enthusiasm for Bond movies\nlasted through the 60s and into the 1970s, it’s fair\nto say that the series almost ground to a halt after\nLicence to Kill’s poor figures. Goldeneye, the first of\nBrosnan’s efforts, heralded a dramatic renewal: not\nsimply because of a new actor but, more significantly,\nbecause of who was behind the camera.', 'However, after a six-year break, Eon installed\nMartin Campbell in the chair: another experienced\nBritish director but one who was able to orchestrate\none of the most elaborate stunts in Bond history.\nThe justly renowned opening scene of Goldeneye\n– during which Bond freefalls into the cockpit of a\npilotless light aeroplane – did much to reinvigorate\nand modernize the series on its own.

On the edge of the Sahara Desert and at the centre of the North African countryÕs ÒOuallywoodÓ  lm industry, it has played host to big-budget location shots in Lawrence of Arabia, The Mummy, The Living Daylights and even Game of Thrones.', 'Now, the trading city, nicknamed the Òdoor of the desertÓ, is the location for another blockbuster Ð a complex of four linked solar mega-plants, which, alongside hydro and wind, will help provide nearly half of MoroccoÕs electricity from renewables by 2020 with, it is hoped, some spare to export to Europe. The project is a key plank in MoroccoÕs ambitions to use its untapped deserts to become a global solar superpower.', 'When the full complex is complete, it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world and the  rst phase, called Noor 1, will go live in November 2015. The mirror technology it uses\ris less widespread and more expensive than the photovoltaic panels that are now familiar on roofs the world over but it will have the advantage of being able to continue producing power even after the sun goes down.', 'The potential for solar power from the desert has been known for decades. In the days after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, the German particle physicist Gerhard Knies calculated that the worldÕs deserts receive enough energy in a few hours to provide for humanityÕs power needs for a whole year. The challenge, though, has been capturing that energy and transporting it to the population centres where it is required.', 'As engineers put the  nishing touches to Noor 1, its 500,000 crescent-shaped solar mirrors glitter across the desert skyline. The 800 rows follow the sun as\rit tracks across the heavens, whirring quietly every few minutes as their shadows slip further east.', 'When they are  nished, the four plants at Ouarzazate will occupy a space as big as MoroccoÕs capital city, Rabat, and generate 580 mega-watts (MW) of electricity, enough to power a million homes. Noor 1 itself has a generating capacity of 160MW.', 'MoroccoÕs Environment Minister, Hakima el-Haite, believes that solar energy could have the same impact on the region this century that oil production had in the last. But the $9bn project to make her countryÕs deserts boom was triggered by more immediate concerns, she said.', 'ÒWe are not an oil producer. We import 94% of our energy as fossil fuels from abroad and that has big consequences for our state budget,Ó el-Haite told the Guardian. ÒWe also used to subsidize fossil fuels, which have a heavy cost, so when we heard about the potential of solar energy, we thought, ÔWhy not?ÕÓ', 'Solar energy will make up a third of MoroccoÕs renewable energy supply by 2020, with wind and hydro taking the same share each.', 'ÒWe are very proud of this project,Ó el-Haite said.

There, it is mixed with water to create steam that turns energy- generating turbines.', 'The HTF is made up of a synthetic thermal oil solution that is pumped towards a heat tank containing molten sands that can store heat\renergy for three hours, allowing the plant to power homes into the night. The mirrors are spaced in tier formations to minimize damage from sand blown up by desert winds.', 'Technicians say that the Noor 2 and 3 plants, due to open in 2017, will store energy for up to eight hours Ð opening the prospect of 24/7 solar energy in the Sahara and the surrounding region.', 'ÒThe biggest challenge we faced was being able to  nish the project on time with the performance level we needed to achieve,Ó said Rashid al-Bayad, the project director.', 'But, even as the  rst phase of the project nears completion, Morocco is eyeing grander international ambitions. \x1cWe are already involved in high tension transportation lines to cover the full south of Morocco and Mauritania as a  rst step,\x1d says Ahmed Baroudi, manager of Socie\x01te\x01 d\x19Investissements Energe\x01tiques, the national renewable energy investment  rm.

ÒSpeci cally, we would have to build interconnections, which would not go through the existing one in Spain, and, then, start exporting.Ó', 'Spain has itself prohibited new solar projects because of a lack of interconnectors to transmit\rthe energy to France. The EU has set a target of ensuring that 10% of each member countryÕs power can be transported abroad by cable\rby 2020.', 'In the meantime, Morocco is focused on using solar to meet its own needs for resource independence. This could, one day, include water desalination, in a country that is increasingly being hit by drought as the climate warms.

With the support of neighbourhood groups, the city has begun policing bars and nightclubs more strictly, while, at the same time,  ghting to implement a new Ònoise ordinanceÓ (read: music ordinance).', 'ÒThis is just the wrong time for them to have pursued something like this,Ó complains bar- owner William Walker, who, for reasons of personal choice, hates the anti-smoking law. ÒForcing people outside the bar to smoke is going to exacerbate the tension thatÕs already there.Ó', 'Many of New OrleansÕs best bars and some of its live music spots are in relatively quiet residential neighbourhoods. This neighbourly coexistence is a big part of what makes New Orleans different and charming. Recently, though, this unique social contract has become unacceptable for some people and the fate of New OrleansÕs musical personality feels at stake.', 'Martha Wood lives beside a loud bar that hosts live music. ÒThe bar was one of the deciding factors in me buying the house so I wonÕt ever complain about the noise,Ó says Wood, who also manages a live-music bar which, following a series of noise issues in 2013 (including complaints about the loud smokers outside), became one of New OrleansÕs  rst ever bars legally disallowed from serving drinks to go. ÒNow, any small infraction could get us shut down,Ó says Wood. ÒWe recently installed a smoke eater to help with the smoke because we canÕt open the doors at night because of\rthe ÔnoiseÕ.Ó', 'The Maple Leaf club went smoke-free voluntarily in 2014 as did another club where artists had been demanding smoke-free nights. ÒA lot of the performance venues were already starting to show that consideration to performers so I wish the city would have just let that happen instead of forcing the ban into every corner bar that doesnÕt host music,Ó says Zalia BeVille, manager of the All Ways Lounge, which went smoke-free in 2013 because, she says, ÒThe horn players and the singers, they asked us for it.Ó', 'Luckily, All Ways has an outdoor patio, unlike Lost Love Lounge, whose owner, Geoff Douville, loves the ban Ð heÕd previously felt forced to live with smoke to keep his bar  nancially viable. ÒThereÕs no way I could have banned smoking\rin my bar without it being a rule throughout the whole city,Ó says Douville. ÒPeople act like I have that choice, as a business owner. But, if I make that rule, they walk down the block to a bar with smoking. So I need it to be uniformed across the board for everybody.Ó', 'Many small business owners also fear smoke- free revenue loss. Smoker Neil Timms owns an English pub and met the smoking ban before,\rin England. ÒBack home in Coventry, every pub where I was a regular closed within a year of the smoking ban,Ó remembers Timms of the UKÕs ban, begun in 2007. To avoid the same fate, heÕs spending money to build a patio.', 'Lost LoveÕs Douville, though, feels the ban to\rbe a great business opportunity. ÒThe number of people who would enjoy coming out to our bar, with our food, but would never come because they didnÕt want to smell like smoke for the next seven days Ð weÕre now an option for all those people.Ó Nor does Douville worry about noise complaints like Walker does: ÒNo court is gonna label a bar a ÔnuisanceÕ after the city has rati ed a smoking ban that requires you to go outside!Ó he says. ÒI want to see a judge reconcile Ôno loiteringÕ with Ôno smoking insideÕ.Ó', 'Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell, who introduced and pushed the ban, disagrees: ÒThe responsibility is on the bar-owner to keep their clientele respectful outside their establishment as well,Ó she says. ÒThe owners and bartenders need to tell them to go have a smoke but be respectful to their communities. The idea that we canÕt have clean air because it will cause noise problems is ridiculous. It can be a win-win. I think itÕs about communication and creating partnerships between the communities and\rthe businesses.Ó', 'Cantrell does acknowledge the cityÕs uniqueness in terms of a smoking ban. ÒHow is New Orleans different from the rest of the country? New Orleans is known as Ôthe City that Care ForgotÕ,Ó she says. ÒNew Orleans needs to stand up\rand say ÔWe care about our peopleÕ. The most vulnerable people who are working in smoky conditions, these citizens are the backbone of our hospitality industry, which drives the economy in the state of Louisiana.Ó She adds, ÒNew Orleans is also unlike other places because you do have the option of taking your drink outside with you when you go out to smoke.Ó', 'Many worried that the already strained New Orleans Police Department didnÕt need any part in policing smokers. So the health department will handle bar warnings and  nes. Bar customers are encouraged to Òcome  ll out a form or call 311 and to include date-and-time-stamped photographs documenting illegal smokingÓ. For this reason alone, Neil Timms says heÕll comply with the ban: ÒI donÕt want someone to be sitting in the corner smoking and someone takes a photo of Õem and gets beaten up.Ó', 'Unworried, Geoff Douville says that heÕs used\rto noise complaints by now so bring on the ban. ÒWatch: the nosy neighbours who complain about the noise now are gonna be the same ones who wanted the smoking ban to begin with.Ó In the end, Douville shares CantrellÕs win-win optimism. ÒOf course theyÕre gonna complain,Ó he accepts. ÒBut it doesnÕt mean theyÕre gonna win.Ó']"

It requires a lot of skills and changing peopleÕs mindsets because selling and eating ice cream is not part of our culture. I think being able to innovate and introduce this on the market, and the process of making it, is\rquite interesting.Ó', 'The Butare shop employs nine women, who spend their spare time practising with Ingoma Nshya, RwandaÕs  rst and only female drumming troupe, which was established by Katese ten years ago.', 'The musicians are Hutu and Tutsi women, some survivors of the 1994 genocide, during which almost a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed.', 'Some members of Ingoma Nshya are widows, some orphans. Others have been affected by the massacre in different ways.', 'Historically, says Ingabire, Rwandan women were forbidden to drum and many people considered the drums too heavy for women to carry. ÒBut itÕs something which brings unity.Ó', 'IngabireÕs father, two siblings and many cousins were killed in the genocide. ÒSome of us are survivors; some know someone who was killed,Ó she says. ÒWhen IÕm drumming with them, it gives me power because weÕre still alive and survivors.Ó', 'The popular eatery features in a documentary by Rob and Lisa Fruchtman, sibling  lm-makers. Sweet Dreams, which tells the story of how the women have forged a promising post-genocide future, also includes the female drummers.', 'The  lm, which has been screened in more than a dozen countries, including the US, UK and several African states, premieres in Rwanda\rin 2014.

Drumlines, used to catch the sharks, are indiscriminate killers. TheyÕll kill sharks whether theyÕre one, two, three metres or more, as well as dolphins, turtles and other things. ThatÕs why the community doesnÕt want it.Ó', 'Thousands of people protested on PerthÕs Cottesloe Beach and SydneyÕs Manly Beach,\ras well as hundreds at Glenelg, in south-\rwest Adelaide, and at beaches in Victoria and Queensland. Faehrmann said the protests had shown Australians wanted sharks protected: ÒWhatÕs amazing is so many people in Australia love sharks. This has demonstrated something about the national psyche, that, despite Jaws, despite all the fear, people are coming out in their thousands across the country to say, ÔThatÕs their ocean. We respect them, we love them and we donÕt want them killed.ÕÓ Anthony Joyce, a surfer who once had his foot caught in a sharkÕs mouth, said: ÒThe number of sharks they are going to kill is going to make no difference in the scheme\rof things.Ó', 'The state government has refused to provide a running tally of sharks killed, though there have been reports of sharks smaller than three metres being released after getting caught on drumlines,  oating drums anchored to the sea bed with bait hanging on hooks beneath them. Conservationists argue there is no evidence the cull will reduce the number of shark attacks on humans, as no previous cull has solely used drumlines. Researchers at the University of Western Australia say the recent spate of shark attacks in the state may have more to do with the state having the fastest-growing population in Australia, rather than a rising number of sharks.', 'Richard Peirce, chairman of the UK-based conservation charity, the Shark Trust, said that the cull would be ineffective and potentially\rlure more predators towards the coast. ÒThe activity in Western Australia is compounding\rthe human tragedy of shark attacks. It is very sad that a government that could be seen to\rtake positive initiatives with regards to sharkÐ human interactions by trialling alternatives to indiscriminate killing has ignored the best advice and opted for an approach that is ineffective and counterproductive,Ó he said. ÒThe indiscriminate nature of drumlines is often overlooked Ð even\rif monitored through the day, leaving the lines\rin overnight has the potential to attract other predators into the area, attracted by those sharks and other species hooked and injured.Ó', 'Globally, in 2012, there were 80 unprovoked attacks by sharks, seven of which proved fatal, compared to nearly 100m sharks killed by humans each year. RSPCA Australia released a statement saying it believes the cull is unjusti ed. ÒThere is no evidence that the increase in attacks is a result of increasing shark numbers. Rather,\rit is consistent with a changing population and human behaviour; that is, there are greater numbers of people in the water,Ó it said.', 'Richard Branson told Fairfax Radio the policy was back ring. ÒIÕm sure one of the reasons Western Australia Premier, Colin Barnett, did it was because he was thinking it would encourage tourism. ItÕs going to do quite the reverse, I think. YouÕre advertising a problem that doesnÕt exist\rin a major way and youÕre deterring people from wanting to come to Perth and your beautiful countryside around it. All youÕre going to achieve, I think, is to worry people unnecessarily.Ó']"

That could allow a retailer to automatically put targeted ads on screens aimed speci cally at that person. If she looks like the type of person who wants to buy socks, they will show her adverts for socks.', 'If it sounds familiar, itÕs because the online world has been using techniques like these for years. If you search for something on Amazon, youÕll be hounded by targeted banners for similar products on other sites. Express a vague interest in canoeing and youÕll get ads for canoes wherever you go. Yet bringing these systems into the physical world isnÕt a simple case of copy and paste. It turns out that people do not react to cameras in the same way as they do to\rbrowser cookies.', 'Hoxton Analytics, a London-based team of data scientists, has developed a technology that makes use of machine learning and arti cial intelligence to categorize people based on the shoes they are wearing. By analysing the style and size of peopleÕs footwear as they walk past the sensor, the system can identify a customerÕs gender with between 75 and 80% accuracy.', 'Owen McCormack, Hoxton Analytics CEO, says that the focus of the system came about in part as a reaction to facial recognition. ÒMy idea was, why donÕt we simply consider the clothes someoneÕs wearing to understand demographics?Ó he said. ÒIf I just showed you a shot of someoneÕs body you could probably tell me what gender they are. However, it turns out pointing a camera at someoneÕs chest or hips feels just as creepy as facial recognition. The idea was Ð what about peopleÕs shoes?Ó', 'The word ÒcreepyÓ comes up a lot during discussions of in-store tracking. For retailers and data scientists, the aim is to  nd a way of obtaining information without coming across as intrusive.', 'For Hoxton Analytics and the retailers using the technology, the answer is to look downwards. This tactic of avoiding the face and staring at shoes says a lot about how we, as physical beings, react to being watched. It suggests there are boundaries that do not exist on the internet. Set sights on our torsos and we feel invaded. But is making calculated judgments about a person based on their footwear actually any\rless invasive?', 'For McCormack, the argument hinges on the fact that personally identi able information isnÕt being collected. ÒRight now, shops are doing lots of incredibly invasive things but we just donÕt know about it. The angle Hoxton Analytics is taking on that whole thing is, well, if you know someoneÕs a male or a female, then your advertising will be much more ef cient. If you know that everyone in your shop right now is a male, youÕll be\radvertising PlayStations not hairdryers.Ó', 'Keep it hidden and invisible monitoring lets shops optimize their output while keeping the customer unaware. Put adaptable monitors and targeted advertising into the mix, however, and it becomes harder to hide the fact that a machine is watching you. The argument from the retailers is that they do this to provide a personal shopping experience but it remains a grey area. It still feels creepy.', 'From the perspective of retailers, itÕs understandable that physical shops want some\rof the information online outlets collect. We allow this to happen online so why not of ine? The thresholds of a shopping centre are different\rfrom those between websites and, when you can wander freely from one place to another without a pop-up asking you to accept cookies, the rules of consent change.', 'Then again, for a generation growing up with online  rst, physical shop second, the modes\rof online play may not be quite so invasive. In the CSC report, a survey indicated that while 72% of respondents aged 55 and over said they were very uncomfortable with these types of technologies being used in physical shops, only 51% of 16-24 year olds said the same.', 'Does this relative openness stem from a greater familiarity with digital technology or a blind belief in the goodwill of omnipresent organizations offering free services? Is the creepiness of a technology an unvarying, instinctive certainty\ror does it ebb and  ow with degrees of social acceptance? Whatever the case, there are a growing number of eyes between the shelves and they care a lot about what youÕre wearing.']"

It brings stronger relationships with those you love, a stronger economy with more opportunities and a stronger society that re ects all of our values,Ó wrote Zuckerberg in the post announcing the numbers.', 'These are just some of the ways his company changed everything Ð for better or worse.', '1 Facebook has changed the de nition of ÒfriendÓ\rÒTo friendÓ is now a verb. And, unlike in real life, when the ending of a friendship can be deeply traumatic, it is easy to ÒunfriendÓ, a word invented to describe ditching a casual acquaintance when they are no longer enhancing your Facebook newsfeed.', 'Although the meanings of the words ÒshareÓ and ÒlikeÓ are essentially the same, Facebook has brought an entirely new weight to the terms.', 'School and university reunions have become redundant Ð you already know whose career is going well, whether the perfect pair have split and youÕve seen endless pictures of your schoolmatesÕ babies. You wonÕt be surprised by an ex in the street with a new girlfriend or boyfriend: you already know theyÕre dating someone else from the romantic sel es.', 'But, unlike in real life, Facebook has no hierarchy\rof friendships.

Professor Robin Dunbar is famous for his research that suggests a person can only have roughly 150 people as a social group. Facebook hasnÕt changed that yet, he believes, but, in an interview with the New Yorker, Dunbar said he feared it was so easy simply to end friendships on Facebook that, eventually, there may no longer be any need to learn to get along.', '2 We care less about privacy\rThereÕs a wise saying: if youÕre not paying for\rit, youÕre the product. Facebook embodies that philosophy and created an entire industry from it. The astonishing thing is that users know that and they willingly hand over that information.', 'Pew Research Center found that most young people are more than willing to hand over their details.\rAn overwhelming majority of 91% post a photo\rof themselves, 71% post the city or town where\rthey live, up from 61%, more than half give email addresses and a  fth give their phone number.', 'But, as so much of a personÕs life is shared online, Facebook gives a platform for everyone to cultivate an image and a fanbase. In an article for the journal Frontiers in Psychology, academics described a new phenomenon, the emergence of the ÒFacebook selfÓ.', 'More than 80% list their interests, allowing brands to target them most effectively. But most younger users do restrict their pro les, with 60% allowing\rfriends only.', '3 Facebook has created millions of jobs Ð but not in its own of ces\rFacebook has essentially created an entire sector, including indirect employment for people whose job it is to make the platform work for their brand.', 'ÒIt is a tool like no other,Ó said Michael Tinmouth, a social media strategist who has worked with brands such as Vodafone and Microsoft. ÒMarketers have an understanding of a brandÕs consumers like they have never had before. The data and analytics available to you are extraordinary. You know who your customers are, who they are friends with and how they engage with your brand.Ó', 'And advertisers pay a lot for that. Facebook reported ad revenue was up 46%, reaching $3.32bn.', 'Facebook is also a mine eld for brands. Suddenly, rather than complaint conversations taking\rplace over the phone with a customer service representative or on a small specialist internet forum, angry customers can post their complaints for hundreds of their friends to see or even on the page where all loyal fans of the brand have been carefully cultivated. And an injustice can go viral.', '4 Facebook has been the tool to\rorganize revolutions\rThough the Arab Spring was dubbed the Twitter revolution, organizing demonstrations and direct action has been revolutionized by Facebook. Manchester UniversityÕs Olga Onuch found Facebook had been the key medium for reaching half of all the Euromaidan protesters in Ukraine.', 'Facebook posts signalled the start of the Maidan protests during the hours after it was announced that Ukraine would not sign a free trade and association agreement with the EU, Onuch found. The posts organized live action, not just online anger. Mustafa Nayyem, the Ukraine activist, posted: ÒIf you really want to do something, donÕt just ÔlikeÕ this post. LetÕs meet near the monument to independence in the middle of the Maidan.Ó', 'Many of those interviewed in OnuchÕs research said they relied on Facebook for the truth about what was happening Ð unable to trust traditional media.', '5 Facebook makes news, breaks news and decides what is news\rRoughly 71% of 18- to 24-year-olds say the internet is their main news source and 63% of users overall, according to the Pew Research Center. About a third of Facebook users post about politics\rand government.', 'Most people will  rst encounter a piece of journalism or an item of breaking news via Facebook or other social media, and most of those encounters will be on mobiles.', 'Users might never have to leave the site to get their news: Instant Articles will see stories run within Facebook. It allows news companies to sell ads around their articles, gaining them 100% of that revenue, while Facebook can also sell ads around that article, with 70% of the revenue from the social networkÕs advertising also going to the news companies.', 'Facebook has also changed the ways journalists write stories. It is a resource many reporters cannot now live without. For better or (often) worse, it is a directory to  nd, contact and glean information for almost any ordinary person, who might suddenly  nd themselves at the centre of the dayÕs biggest news story. Facebook has its own newswire, sharing the most useful user reaction to breaking stories, including pictures and videos.', '6 Users are changing Facebook\rIt used to be a site to get students connected, with only elite US universities allowed access.', 'In 2014, a decade after its launch, 56% of internet users aged 65 and older have a Facebook account. And 39% are connected to people they have never met in person.', 'Groups have given way to pages, writing on each other\x19s walls is passe\x01 and carefully curated albums have given way to instant mobile uploads. More than ever, the site is a gateway not just to your friends but to the rest of the internet.', 'We may as well get used to it, said David Kirkpatrick, author of The Facebook Effect.

And evidence shows that our heart rate doesnÕt drop during breath-holding. At least, it doesnÕt if youÕre breath-holding on land. When youÕre in cold water, itÕs different: this leads to a slower heart rate in most people. But, once again, this isnÕt evidence of an aquatic ape ancestry.\rThis reduction in heart rate is just one of the physiological responses that are sometimes called the Òmammalian diving re exÓ.

If you arti cially raise oxygen levels and reduce carbon dioxide levels before a breath-hold, as in the Birmingham radiotherapy experiments, you may be able to delay tiredness in the diaphragm.

And experimental evidence shows that heart rate doesnÕt drop during breath-holding. At least, it doesnÕt if youÕre breath-holding on land. When youÕre submerged in cold water itÕs a different story: cooling the face does lead to a slower heart rate in most people.

Arti cially raising oxygen levels and reducing carbon dioxide levels before a breath-hold, as in the Birmingham radiotherapy experiments, may work by delaying fatigue in the diaphragm. And Ð not so useful if youÕre trying to keep your chest perfectly still Ð breathing out a little air lets the diaphragm relax a little, and helps you to prolong a breath-hold, exactly as I found when attempting my breath-hold. And, so, itÕs your diaphragm, the main muscle of breathing, that is also in charge when it comes to reaching the breakpoint of your breath-hold.
